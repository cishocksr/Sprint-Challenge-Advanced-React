- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
      You would use class componentâ€™s over functional components to have more control over the logic of the state.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
      The three react life cycles are mounting, updating, and unmounting. Mounting is where the component is created. This is the initial mounting to the DOM. During updating any changes or updates are pushed to the Virtual DOM that re renders the content. FInally in the unmounting phase the Virtual DOM sends the official content to the DOM for the user to experience.
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      Custom Hooks are use to reuse stateful logic. To refactor our code to be DRY as possible, we can use custom hooks all through the application, similar to mixins in LESS.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
      Testing our applications are important because human error is guaranteed. To be sure that your application will work the way you want, in all circumstances it is best to test. When in the world of production, testing saves money.
